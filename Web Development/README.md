# Purpose

--- 

This section will be dedicated to annotate Web Development things that might be good to remember from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which is a free course that teaches you about web development.

I should be able to answer every question with this only, if I need to research some specific thing, then that means I need to expand my notes in here.
