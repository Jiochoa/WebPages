# The Odin Project
---

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to understand FULLY how to be a ==full-stack developer==

#### How to ask programming questions [^1]
1. Understand the code to the best of your abilities
2. Clearly describe the problem
3. Provide the code that illustrates the problem
4. Make sure the code you're sharing can reproduce the problem
5. Format your code consistently
6. check yourself for typos
7. Explain what you did to troubleshoot the problem
8. Explain what you think the problem might be
9. Proofread your question
10. Send updates and remember this will not be your last question.

#### XY Problem[^2] 
X is the solution you're looking for and Y is the solution you think you need to solve X.

The issue comes when you ask for help with Y instead of X because you think Y would solve the problem, therefore causing more unnecessary problems for you and the people that are trying to help you.

Example: delete the file extension and asking to delete the last 3 characters of the name file.

Problem: not all extensions are 3 letters long, so you're asking to solve a problem that's not going to solve the actual problem


#### How to ask good questions in Stack Overflow
1. Write a title that summarizes the specific problem
	- Why does using float instead of int gives me different results when all of my inputs are integers.
2. Introduce the problem before you post any code
	- How you encounter the problem and any difficulties preventing you from solving it.
3. Help others reproduce the problem
	- Include just enough code to reproduce the problem
	- Live demos are recommended [^3]
4. Include all relevant tags
5. Proof read before posting
6. Post the question and respond to feedback
	- Keep the question open to answer any questions and try the given solutions
7. Look for help asking for help
	-  Some questions might be poorly received, redo it and ask it again


#### How to use Google to solve your programming questions
##### Getting general overview
- Read a few posts before settling for the one you decide to focus on
##### Narrowing the time span
- Set the time span for a year to avoid getting coding answers for now irrelevant problems that might have occurred before current updates

##### Using quotation marks to search for specific phrases
- Coding in flow gives different results than "Coding in flow"

##### Excluding words with "-"
- Sometimes you need to exclude a word, Singleton for example, so you search: **Android Volley -Singleton**

##### Using image search with a specific picture in mind
??? Image search the feature you want to implement (Example: AlertDialog)

#### Creating an SSH key (personal password that will identify you to GitHub, Heroku, Netlify)
